# Homework 1 Solution
## Introduction to C++11 and its Concurrency Features

## Description
This assignment will require that you update ``main.cpp`` such that it uses the 
Standard Library threading components talked about in class. 
If your system has been properly setup (or you are using a lab computer). This 
assignment should take no more than two hours to complete. 

## Directions
  
  0. Documentation 
    1. Create a blank document that contains your full name and the assignment 
    name (Homework 1).
  1. Coding Section
    1. First take a look at ``main.cpp.old``. This file contains the original 
    code which makes use of the posix thread library.
    2. Take a look at ``main.cpp``. This will be the file that you will update 
    such that it uses the C++11 Standard Library thread components.
    3. Update ``main.cpp`` such that all comments that contain _TODO_ 
    statements are replaced with the proper code.
    4. Build the code by running ``make all`` in the terminal. Simply running 
    ``make`` will print what commands will be executed by the Makefile.
    5. You have the option to either run ``speedtest.sh`` or run the ``syncron``
    executable. 
    6. Take a screenshot of the results and paste them into the document.
  2. Question Section
    1. In ``main.cpp`` locate the three questions in the comments.
    2. In your document write down your answer for each question. 
    Make sure that I know what question each answer belongs to.

## Learning Goals
After completing this assignment you will have a basic understanding on how to 
import the thread library and make use of threads and mutex locks to 
access a job pool.

## Grading 
The homework is worth a maximum of 100 points.

  - Answer the three questions located in the comments. +30
  - Replace all the _TODO_ components with the proper code. +50
  - Application compiles and runs without any issues. +20
