# History of GPUs Notes
These notes are based on [A Critical History of Computer Graphics and Animation](https://design.osu.edu/carlson/history/lesson1.html), and other notes when needed. 

There is a long history of computing, but the first modern computer was the ENIAC. A prototype designed to aid the military in calculating weapon trajectories allowed complex numerical computations. It supported addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and the multiplication of square roots. The ENIAC weighed over 30 tons, consumed 200kW, and required 19,000 vacuum tubes to operate. Even though it was inefficient, it played a major role in the evolution of modern computing. 

The first computer that was able to display graphics was the Whirlwind. Designed to receive position data from a radar. It displayed the positions of airplanes on a screen. The operator could then select a plane with a light gun which would cause the computer to display more information about the selected plane. Since the Whirlwind used a CRT to display the data and allow for user input. It served as a predecessor towards modern GPUs.
